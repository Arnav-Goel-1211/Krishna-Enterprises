- Background color: Light cyan (#E0F7FA) to create a clean and fresh look.
- Accent color: Warm yellow (#FFCA28) to highlight important information and CTAs, providing a cheerful and inviting contrast.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for readability and a modern feel.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font, giving a computerized, techy feel that works well for a headline font. This font will be used in combination with 'PT Sans'.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different ink properties, printing processes, and corrugated box types.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear headings, subheadings, and ample whitespace. Ensure the website is responsive and looks great on all devices.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience, such as a color shifting animation when the user moves the mouse over available colors, without being distracting.
